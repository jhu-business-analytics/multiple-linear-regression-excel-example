    "Baltimore City government publishes [open data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/browse?category=City+Government) about their full-time or civil service employee's salary, hire data, and earned income for fiscal years 2011-2019 (Baltimore City government's fiscal year runs from July 1-June 30, where the ending year of each cycle denotes the \"fiscal year\"). While this provides transpareny on these type of employees and some city government salary spending--this doesn't include salaries for contract employees--it is challenging to perform long-term trend analysis on this data because different years' exported data have different column headers, different labels for department names, and different labels for employee names. This notebook aims to clean and organize this data to make it easier to draw long-term comparisons that relate to salary earnings, salary offers, paid position types, and Baltimore City government tenure."
